# Forced Alignment with Aeneas
This python program uses the [aeneas](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas) library to synchronize audio and text data.

## ⚡️ How can I run it?
 1. Open terminal
 2. Run `python3 app.py text_path audio_path`
 3. The program will generate a json file, which can be tuned with [finetuneas](https://github.com/ozdefir/finetuneas)

This program is written to assist data collection in our SDP project.
